# User styles
A few of the user styles I use. [See a preview of 4chan Clean](http://hdni.github.io/rice/assets/4chan_clean.png).

## Installation
* Install the [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) extension.
* Go to your [Add-ons Manager](about:addons), select the User Styles page and then write a new style.
* Give the style a name and paste the contents of the user style you want to install.

## Notes
* 4chan v3 is meant to be used with [Seaweed's fork of 4chan X v3](https://github.com/seaweedchan/4chan-x). My 4chan settings are included; if something doesn't work or doesn't look right, it's most likely because I don't use it.
* Both 4chan Ribbon and Clean are only compatible with 4chan X v2.
* The AnandTech user style is made to suit my usage of the site, it may be incomplete or unsatisfying for you.

##### For best results with 4chan v3, you should enable the following settings:
* Quick Reply, QR Shortcut, Persistent QR, Auto Hide QR;
* Everything under the Menu subcategory;
* Hide Original Post Form.


##### And disable these settings:
* Updater and Stats in Header;
* Quote threading.

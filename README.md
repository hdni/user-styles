# User styles
A few of the user styles I use. [See a preview of 4chan Clean](http://hdni.github.io/rice/assets/4chan_clean.png).

## Installation
* Install the [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) extension.
* Go to your [Add-ons Manager](about:addons), select the User Styles page and then write a new style.
* Give the style a name and paste the contents of the user style you want to install.

## Notes
* Both 4chan Ribbon and Clean are only compatible with 4chan X v2.
* The AnandTech user style is made to suit my usage of the site, it may be incomplete or unsatisfying for you.
